For this assignment, I imported multiple packages including date time, os, sys, requests, pandas, io, and getopt. I wrote the code in Python 3. In order to get and parse user input, I used getopt. For the user entered value, I assumed that the crude_acronym, start_date and end_date are required to enter.
